# README Generator
Ninth week of the Sydney University coding bootcamp, this challenge consisted of developing a backend README Generator using node.js.

Within this challenge, we were required to use specific skills learnt in the past week including utilising inquirer to create several prompts and fs to write files based off the responses of the user.
